YA
===

*Like "Ya mule!"*

### Motivation

We shouldn't have to waste time defining configuration files or build scripts
for small projects. Our tools should do that for us â€“ downloading any
dependencies and recompiling changes along the way.

YA is that tool. It manages Grunt behind the scenes and auto-generates your Gruntfile.

`npm install ya.js`

### Usage

`ya [directory]` (defaults to `.` if directory is not supplied)

Simply run `ya` in an empty or non-empty directory and it'll do the following:

1. generate a dummy package.json (if you don't have one)
2. download (as devDependencies) what's needed for any existing preprocessors found in `directory`
3. generate/overwrite a Gruntfile in `directory`
4. compile any existing files
5. watch `directory` for new preprocessors (repeating steps 2 to 6)
6. watch `directory` for changes and recompile

If you need to customize the Gruntfile for more advanced uses, modify the gruntfile and
just continue to use `grunt` instead of `ya`.

### Preprocessors Supported

**CSS**

* sass
* less

**JS**

* coffee

**HTML**

* jade

Adding support for a new preprocessor involves creating a
new `-settings.js` files in `ya/settings/` and adding the details about the
grunt plugin that should be used for compiling that preprocessor.
